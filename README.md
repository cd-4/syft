# syft
A program for optimal file browsing, movement, and renaming.

##### Welcome
This was designed out of necessity, since my meme folder was becoming unwieldy. For that reason, there isn't much fluff on the program.
It was designed for quick filtering and sorting of files, not for optimally viewing the files, or to look good.
What that means is a significant portion of the actions are done with the keyboard and there simply aren't options for using the mouse, and it also uses the default Qt appearance.

### New Features
If you wish to see any features, I suggest you create an issue and pray that someone decides to take it up, or implement it yourself and create a pull request.
I am open to any new features and PRs until it becomes a burden.
